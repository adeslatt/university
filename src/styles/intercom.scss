/**
 * This is a shim to compensate for the way that Intercom (intercom.com) banners
 * work. It's a decently complicated reason for doing it this way, but here are
 * the high points to any future developers who need to alter this code:
 *
 *  - Intercom currently implements their banners as a separate <iframe />
 *    element outside of the React DOM tree. Their code takes the top-level
 *    <body> element, adds a margin-top of 50 pixels, and changes the height 
 *    to calc(100% - 50px). 
 *  - Our navbar, which is currently has `position: sticky` and `top: 0`
 *    efficiently moves down when the margin-top is applied via the above
 *    mechanism, but if you try to scroll down, the navbar gets hidden behind
 *    the banner (because the top = 0px, which is relative to the viewport
 *    scroll position). 
 *    Changing to `top: 50px` solves this problem, but that attribute only needs
 *    to be set when the banner is shown.
 *  - One way that would have been nice to solve this problem is by
 *    computationally deriving what the top attribute should be in React. But
 *    alas, as I said above, the banner is in an embedded iframe and isn't
 *    accessible from within the React DOM. Any solutions to try to dig into
 *    that iframe, add listeners from menu popin and popout were way to hacky. 
 *  - Instead, I opted for this just as hacky but way easier to implement css
 *    selector. In short, Intercom _always_ applies a margin top of 50px and a
 *    height of `calc(100% - 50px)` when showing a banner. Since using `calc` on
 *    a body element is exceedingly rare, I made the assumption that I could
 *    just write a CSS selector to target anytime `calc` was included in the
 *    `style` element of the body. If the style element contains that, then the
 *    assumption is that the banner is visible, and we manually apply a top
 *    position of 50px. Once the banner is closed, `calc` will be removed from
 *    the style element, and this css rule will no longer fire. Hope that makes sense!
